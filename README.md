## Overview

In the United States, the most advanced math course a normal high school student can take is calculus. Not only does calculus require mastery of prior classes such as algebra, it also demands strong critical thinking skills, 3D reasoning skills, and the ability to reason with infinity, just to name a few skills that students have a hard time grasping. On top of that, passing the AP exam, which is the goal of a lot of students, is another beast altogether. Students are usually under-prepared for the logical connections they have to make to do well on the exam. These factors make calculus dreaded by many students.

While there are plenty of resources online, it is often difficult to comb through all of the content to find the material that is just right. Setting aside the educational quality of the videos, the videos can be too dry for some students to focus on, too in-depth for a struggling student, or too surface-level for a student who wants to kick it up a notch.

The goal of this project is to make a database of YouTube videos where students and educators can nominate and vote on videos for each topic in the AP calculus standard. This method of user-curation has been proven to work as websites such as Reddit have demonstrated. This project aims to take the concept further as suited in the context of education. Instead of only being able to upvote or downvote a video, there are three metrics to be voted on: best basics, best in-depth, and most engaging.

There are multiple advantages for using this instead of other platforms:
- The different voting categories help students and teachers find a video that suit their specific need.
- With the site being modulated into different topics, students can study for specific areas that they struggle in.
- The College Board standards are provided on the page as to help the students know if they have learned all they needed for the topic.
- Since the website is dedicated to educational content, students are less likely to be distracted.

If this project proves to be successful, the same template can be for other subjects such as history, languages, or various disciplines of science. It can also be applied to exams such as the SAT, ACT, or GRE.
